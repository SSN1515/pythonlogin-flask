Login Extension for Flask
The simplest way to add login to flask!

How it works
First, install it from PyPI:

$ pip install flask_simplelogin
Then, use it in your app:

from flask import Flask
from flask_simplelogin import SimpleLogin

app = Flask(__name__)
SimpleLogin(app)
That's it!
Now you have /login and /logout routes in your application.

The username defaults to admin and the password defaults to secret â€” yeah that's not clever, check the docs to see how to configure it properly!
